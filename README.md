# Image-Segmentation

Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple distinct regions or segments based on the characteristics of the pixel in the image. 

Now that we know that each pixel is classified into some class and pixels of same class are grouped together, segmentation can be further classified into the following types:

1. Semantic Segmentation
2. Instance Segmentation
3. Panoptic Segmentation
